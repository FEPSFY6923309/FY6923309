From exploration to excavation there is always a constant danger to human life. Whether it be withstanding the great pressure 
in the deep sea to the extremely low pressure in space or traversing treacherous terrain, humans have invented many autonomous 
vehicles to assist in these areas. The invention of unmanned crafts has revolutionised both exploration and industrial 
operations greatly by minimising the human exposure to extreme environments. With each autonomous vehicle having a designated 
specific role ensuring saftey and efficiency.

unmanned vehicles have significantly enhanced our modern world enableing humans to undergo tasks and explore invironments that 
would be to dangerous or unaccecible otherwise. Humans will constantly face adversity while we grow and explore whether it be 
limitations that prevent the human body from entering areas or our known universe or natural disasters destroying infrastructure. 
There is only so much that the human body can endure before it reaches its limit. This leads to the invention of unmanned vehicles 
which greatly helps to both assist humans in dangerous tasks whilst also keeping casualties down. AUVs (autonomous underwater vehicle) 
and ROVs (remote operated vehicle) are a great example of autonomous vehicles that assist in human exploration (NOAA,2020). Not only 
do unmanned crafts assist us in these extreme environments but they also help in the air with scouting and surveying via UAVs 
(unmanned aerial vehicle) with LIDARs (light detection and ranging) (Wessex Archaeology, n.d.).

The vacuum of space is one of the harshest environments known to humanity, and reaching it is just as dangerous. Because the only 
way to escape Earth’s atmosphere is by rocket, human spaceflight involves significant risk, complex engineering challenges, and 
extremely high financial cost. This is one reason satellites and remotely operated vehicles (ROVs) have become attractive alternatives 
to crewed missions, as they allow exploration without exposing humans to danger. The Apollo program illustrates the expense of human 
spaceflight: it included eleven piloted missions, but only six achieved lunar landings. The program cost 25.8 billion USD at the time, 
equivalent to about 281 billion USD in 2025, meaning each landing cost around 46.8 billion USD (Richard H., 2019).

In contrast, robotic missions are far more economical. The Mars Exploration Rover (MER) mission, for example, cost about 1 billion USD 
in 2019 and remained operational for 15 years (The Planetary Society). Rovers can function in extreme conditions for extended periods 
and require no life-support systems, food, or return capability. They primarily need power and software updates, making them significantly 
cheaper and easier to operate. For this reason, ROVs offer an efficient and cost-effective alternative for exploring environments where 
direct human presence is unnecessary.

Not only are unmanned vehicles used to explore new territories in space, but they are also essential for investigating some of the most 
inaccessible regions of our planet, particularly the deep sea, where the environment becomes nearly as hostile as outer space. Piloted 
missions in the deep ocean are extremely dangerous due to the immense pressure at great depths, requiring the use of specialised 
submarines to ensure human safety (NOAA, 2024). For this reason, autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are commonly used, as they are 
designed to withstand these high pressures and are more space-efficient because they do not require oxygen systems or crew quarters. AUVs 
also greatly reduce risk to human life; if a mechanical failure or pressure-related incident occurs, only the vehicle is lost rather than 
its operators.

 Natural disasters are inevitable, which has led to the development of preparation strategies and post-disaster responses aimed at 
reducing casualties. One example is the use of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which can detect incoming disasters and gather 
real-time information without putting human scouts at risk (Luo et al., 2019). After a disaster occurs, UAVs remain valuable tools, as 
they can navigate damaged or unstable terrain from the air to support search and rescue operations. This allows rescue teams to choose the 
safest possible routes while still responding quickly, since UAVs can cover large areas in a short amount of time. By improving both safety 
and efficiency, UAVs play a crucial role in modern disaster management.
